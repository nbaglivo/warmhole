# warmhole

A warm little portal from your static site into the fediverse.

warmhole is a small, self-hosted server that turns your site's feed into a
fediverse account. People follow `@you@your-site.dev` from Mastodon, and each
new post shows up in their timeline. Your site stays static.

## How it works

Your site keeps publishing its RSS, Atom or JSON Feed. After each deploy, it
pings warmhole. warmhole reads the feed, works out what's new, edited or
removed, and sends it to your followers. Follows are accepted automatically.
Likes, boosts and replies are ignored for now.

Design and diagrams: [`docs/design.html`](docs/design.html).

## Run it

1. Copy `warmhole.example.json` to `warmhole.json` and fill in one entry per
   site. `syncTokenEnv` names an environment variable holding a long random
   token for that site.
2. Run the container, with the database on a volume you back up (it holds
   each site's private keys):

   ```bash
   docker build -t warmhole .
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
     -e MY_BLOG_SYNC_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
     -v "$PWD/warmhole.json:/config/warmhole.json:ro" \
     -v warmhole-data:/data \
     warmhole
   ```

3. Put it behind HTTPS at the `publicUrl` from your config.

On a server of your own, `compose.yml` runs warmhole behind Caddy, which gets
the HTTPS certificate for you. Point your domain's DNS at the server, then:

```bash
cp warmhole.example.json warmhole.json
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

`.env` sets `WARMHOLE_DOMAIN` (the host of `publicUrl`) and each site's sync
token. To move to another server, copy `warmhole.json`, `.env` and the
`warmhole-data` volume, then point the DNS at the new machine. Keep
`publicUrl` the same: it is your account's identity in the fediverse.

Without Docker: `mise install && npm ci && npm start`. Settings come from
`WARMHOLE_CONFIG` (default `./warmhole.json`), `WARMHOLE_DB` (default
`./data/warmhole.db`) and `PORT` (default `8080`).

## Connect a site

1. **WebFinger.** Download `https://<publicUrl>/sites/<id>/webfinger.json` and
   publish it on your site at `/.well-known/webfinger`, served as
   `application/jrd+json`. On Cloudflare Pages, add to `_headers`:

   ```
   /.well-known/webfinger
     Content-Type: application/jrd+json
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   ```

2. **Ping after deploy.** In GitHub Actions:

   ```yaml
   - name: Notify warmhole
     run: >
       curl --fail --retry 3 -X POST
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.WARMHOLE_SYNC_TOKEN }}"
       https://ap.example.dev/sites/my-blog/sync
   ```

   The response says what happened, for example
   `{"new":1,"updated":0,"deleted":0}`. Pinging again is always safe.

The first ping for a site saves the existing posts without sending them, so new
followers aren't flooded.

With `"deleteMissing": true`, a post that disappears from the feed is deleted
for followers too. Posts older than the oldest entry in the feed are left
alone, so feeds that list only the latest posts are safe.

## Check it works

- `npx @fedify/cli lookup @you@your-site.dev` should show your actor.
- `npx @fedify/cli inbox` gives you a throwaway account to follow from.
- Then follow from a real Mastodon account, publish a post and ping.

## Watch what it does

warmhole logs one JSON line per event: each sync and what it found, each
follow and unfollow, each delivery and any follower it gave up on.
`scripts/logs` reads them over SSH and prints them one short line each:

```bash
export WARMHOLE_SSH=root@203.0.113.7
scripts/logs              # last 200 lines
scripts/logs -f           # follow live
scripts/logs --since 1h
```

```
12:43:48 synced inner-monologue: 1 new, 0 updated, 0 deleted
12:43:49 sent Create creating-a-life → mastodon.social
```

`WARMHOLE_SSH_KEY` picks an SSH key and `WARMHOLE_DIR` the folder on the server
(default `/opt/warmhole`).

## Development

```bash
npm test
npm run typecheck
```
